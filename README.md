Population and Arable Land Clock
================================

This Javascript dynamically displays the Earth's human population and acres of productive land based on information from the United Nations. The original script was written by Kevin McCann in March 1996, and revised and updated by John Harris Stevenson in 1999. The clock has been hosted since 1999 at [tranquileye.com/clock](tranquileye.com/clock/).

You may use this script as you see fit, but please retain proper credit. Also, be aware that the script depends on data that is non-static: the starting land and population numbers, as well as  rates of increase/decrease that are recalculated yearly. These values have changed quite a bit since 1999!
